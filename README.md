# My AI Learning Journey

Status: Currently focused on Classical Machine Learning (Phase A)

This repository tracks my hands-on journey through the core concepts of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning (ML), and Generative AI (GenAI). My goal is to build a functional portfolio and document the end-to-end process for each project.

üó∫Ô∏è Learning Roadmap & Progress

This map follows a structured approach, building from fundamentals (Phase A) to advanced application (Phase C).

Phase A: Classical ML & Structured Data (Target: Completion)

    ‚úÖ Python & Libraries: Solid grasp of Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.

    ‚úÖ Classification Warm-up: Implemented Decision Tree (Iris Dataset).

    ‚òê Regression Warm-up: Implement Linear Regression (Housing Dataset).

    ‚òê Portfolio Project 1: End-to-End Customer Churn Prediction.

Phase B: Deep Learning & Generative AI (Next Up)

    ‚òê Deep Learning Fundamentals (TensorFlow/PyTorch).

    ‚òê Generative AI Application (LLM API Integration).

    ‚òê Portfolio Project 2: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System.

Phase C: Production & Deployment (Future)

    ‚òê MLOps Basics (Git/Cloud).

    ‚òê Final Project Deployment (Streamlit/Gradio).
